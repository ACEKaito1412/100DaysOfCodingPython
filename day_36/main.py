# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").

    news_data = check_news()

    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

    #TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
    article = [{'headline':key['title'],'description': key['content']} for key in news_data]

    #TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.
    for item in article:
        sendArticle(item['title'], item['description'])



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
