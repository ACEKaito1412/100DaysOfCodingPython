# Day 1
    - this is my day one out of 100 in coding challenge with python for a 100 day.
    - what this day one is about a simple classic hello world program
    - where we learn how to output text and get an input from a user.
    - this also talks about a simple debuging about indentation,
    - and proper naming of your variables
    - as we might get back to it, when on bigger scale project we might get back to that variable
    - and we dont know what that variable do

## This was my day one. Ace is out.
